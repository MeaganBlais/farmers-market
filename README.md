# farmers-market
Final project for LHL: we are using what we learned in the past 6.5 weeks of full time bootcamp and applying it to one working app. This group consists of four members: Katia, Meagan, Rose, and Vasily.

We are a hub where farmers (after signing in) can present the items they are currently selling, the dates, and choose the markets they will be at. Users can search by farmer, market name, product, location, or specific detail.

MVP, React/Javascript for real time, Ruby on Rails for back end, PostgreSQL for database so we can use relational databases
